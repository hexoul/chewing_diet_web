    "content": "Leptin, a hormone that suppresses appetite, is released at least 15 minutes after the start of a meal. Chewing slowly enhances leptin secretion. Therefore, finishing a meal in under 15 minutes may limit leptin release, reducing feelings of fullness and increasing the risk of overeating.\n\nPeople who eat meals in less than 5 minutes have a significantly higher risk of:\n- Obesity (3 times higher)\n- Diabetes (2 times higher)\n- Hyperlipidemia (1.8 times higher)\n- Fatty liver (23 times higher)\n\nThorough chewing, ideally 20 to 30 times per bite, breaks food into smaller pieces and promotes even mixing with saliva, aiding digestion. Eating too quickly without proper chewing can strain the stomach."
