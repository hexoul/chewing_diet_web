      "Love the concept! As someone who is a fast eater, I really enjoyed using this timer app to help me regulate how fast I eat. I also love the science behind how eating slower can help me. I hope that I will see more updates with better translation and better instructions! Being able to change the chewing timer face is a bonus!",
